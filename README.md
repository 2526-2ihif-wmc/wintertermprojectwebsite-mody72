# Anime Aesthetic Wallpaper Gallery

This website is a small HTML & CSS project focused on anime style aesthetic wallpapers generated with AI and available for free use.

The main idea of the site is to showcase how AI generated images can be useful for wallpapers, backgrounds, and design inspiration, while also organizing them in a clearer way than many stock image platforms do. Some sites (like StockCake) provide free images but do not always categorize them in a helpful or aesthetic focused way.

This project groups wallpapers by visual style and mood (such as aesthetic, black & white, etc.) to make browsing easier and more intuitive.

The website is built using:
- HTML  
- CSS

All images used are free to use and properly credited to their sources.
